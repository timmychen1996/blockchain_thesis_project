## About the System
This is the project for my grad thesis which relates to International trade in Logistics. 
The project replaces traditional International trade with Dapp. Dapp is the decentralized apllication running on EVM, whose funtionality is implemented by smart contract.
Our goal is to simplify the International trading process with smart contract and eliminate the unnecessary cost
  withe regard to different documents involvement.

### Smart Contract
(1) It is simply a program written in Solidity, which is a language with C++ and javascript   
(2) It executes term of agreement between different parties in certain condition   
(3) After the program is compiled, it will store in Ethereum blockchain environment


## Environment Setting
1. Ganache
2. Soliidty: version( >=0.4.22 < 0.60)
3. Web3.js(version 1.2.4)
4. Truffle(version 5.1.0)
5. npm(version 6.11.3)
6. nod


摘要
有鑑於傳統國際貿易之物件傳遞與貨物運送流程，以往的
溝通均透過紙本或是傳真的方式，然而會耗費相關人力成本
及效率，而近年來，有相關之研究透過區塊鏈可程式化功能
此次研究目的透過區塊鏈之建設環境
