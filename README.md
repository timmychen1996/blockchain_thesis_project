## About the System
This is the project for my grad thesis which relates to International trade in Logistics. 
The project replaces traditional International trade with Dapp. Dapp is the decentralized apllication running on EVM, whose funtionality is implemented by smart contract.
Our goal is to simplify the International trading process with smart contract and eliminate the unnecessary cost
  withe regard to different documents involvement.

(3) After the program is compiled, it will store in Ethereum blockchain environment.
